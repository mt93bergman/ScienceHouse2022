    "Simulations are a powerful tool in computational science. Simulations are built using physical laws and allow us to  understand how extremely complex systems behave, such as how the climate is expected to change over the century or how the brain works. Today, we will be using a simulation to investigate the behavior of a mixture of microplastics in water. Specfically, we will be looking at how microplastics aggregate using a very simple model. \"Aggregation\" means that the plastics stick to each other and clump up, rather than staying separated from each other. To model microplastic aggregation, we will model microplastics as spheres of the same size, and any two microplastics that come in contact will stick to each other. Using this simple model, we will try to answer the below questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -Does microplastic pollution tend to aggregate or remain isolated?\n",
    "    -How does the aggregation depend on the properties of the plastic and environmental conditions?\n",
    "    -Does the aggregation tendency change as the plastic concentration increases?"

    "You should have received the message \"All particles have aggregated, ending program!\". But what actually happened?  Let's call the analyze function to find out. This function will generate two things: a video showing how the trajectories of the plastics, and a plot showing the aggregation of the system. Here, we are describing the aggregation based on the number of clusters in the system. A cluster is any set of plastic particles that are contacting each other. We initially start with 20 clusters because there are a total of 20 particles in the system and no particles have aggregated yet.

As we conclude, it is very important to again emphasize that our simulations is a very simplified version of how microplastics actually behave. Due to these simplifications, the simulations are not guaranteed to accurately reproduce the actual microplastic aggregation.

    "In the bigger picture, why should we care about the aggregation of microplastics? As hinted at earlier, aggregation fundamentally changes the behavior of small materials. It can change whether microplastics sink or float in water, the rate at which they are degraded in the environment, and how they interact with tissues and cells in an organisms. On a more positive note, understanding the aggregation tendencies of microplastics may also lead to potential strategies to remediate microplastic pollution. Thus, investigating the aggregation of microplastics is an important step in understanding the environmental and health impacts of microplastics and developing remediation strategies. "
